# Roadmap

SchwiftUI was conceptualised at `Version 0.0.1`. When Phoenix LiveView 1.18-rc was announced, it saw the support for daisyUI. As a result, the roadmap to `0.1` is to ensure that all daisyUI components are supported.

`Version 0.2` will oversee the deviation from daisyUI classes, or at least provide a custom theme. Components may become stateful during this version. As a result, values will be able to passed through and contribute to updating UI.

`Version 0.3` will have support for containers and layouts. Developers will have access to container components such as SwiftUI's `NavigationStack` or `NavigationSplitView`. This will mean that UI elements, such as split columns, sidebars and navigation headers, will be provided with one line of code.

I have not thought much further than these three initial versions.
