# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to SchwiftUI. Your time and effort is greatly appreciated.

## Getting Started

A `Phoenix Storybook` app is available to understand the various SchwiftUI components.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you would like to report a bug or provide feedback, please create a new issue. Please ensure that the issue doesn't already exist before opening one.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through the existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.

As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
2. Run `mix deps.get` to fetch dependencies.
3. Run `mix test`.
4. Create a new branch.
5. Make changes and commit.
6. Create a pull request.

### Pull Request

- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a SchwiftUI member will review your proposal. Additional  questions or information may be required.
- Changes may be asked before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
